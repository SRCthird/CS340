## **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I follow best practices like modular programming, clear documentation, and meaningful variable names. In Project One, the CRUD Python module provided a reusable and structured way to interact with the database, making it easier to connect with the dashboard widgets in Project Two. This modular approach allowed for easy debugging and future expansion, and I could reuse the module in other applications that require database interactions.

## **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
I break the problem into smaller, manageable components and look though the requirements before approaching a solution. For the dashboard project, I first identified how the database should store and retrieve data, then designed the dashboard to display it effectively. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more real-world problem-solving, and in the future, I would focus on optimizing database queries and structuring data to scale with client needs.  

## **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists develop software solutions that improve efficiency, automate processes, and solve complex problems. My work on this project helped Grazioso Salvare by providing an interactive dashboard that streamlines animal tracking and adoption management. This allowes for faster decision-making and better resource allocation, ultimately improving the companyâ€™s ability to save and rehome animals.
